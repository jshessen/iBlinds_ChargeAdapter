# iBlinds_ChargeAdapter
Custom iBlinds charge adapter clip for cordless blinds.

I have incorporated a few [iBlinds](https://myiblinds.com/) into my overall home automation.

Recently, I was looking to expand some of this automation to cover a series of "cordless" horizontal blinds.  While researching compatability, I noticed a few limitations from the [iBlinds FAQ](https://support.myiblinds.com/faqs/):

*"Is iblinds compatible with my cordless lift blinds?"*
![Is iblinds compatible with my cordless lift blinds?](https://support.myiblinds.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Iblinds_Cordless-Lift-Checklist-1024x746.jpg)

My project met all of the requirements, **except, the *CUTOUT ON BOTTOM OF HEADRAIL ONLY...***, and hoped to fashion (3D Print) my own clip adapter after the fact.

This repository is the work product in creating a design which was able to create a viable clip to properly hold the iBlinds Charge Adapter on a headrail where the tilt mechanism extends through the corner of the headrail.

I have included STL for the object, as rendered from OpenSCAD, as well as the design file, and a 3MF file.
